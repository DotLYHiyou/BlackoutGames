## Notice
Blackout will be remade soon under a new name and completely reimagined, with new layers of security against things like Securly and GoGuardian. It will be better, faster, and more long-lasting than before. Please note that this does not mean the links that Blackout has will be decommissioned, we will keep them and make new ones as well. Blackout will stay open, and this remake wont take too long. Make sure to join the Discord server for more updates.
